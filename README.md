# OFDMModulationRecognition

MATLAB files are used to generate noiseless and noisy data examples to train and test the neural network created in net.py and read_data.py

Data generated from GNU Radio's OFDM block are used to train and test the neural network created in net_radio.py and read_data_radio.py

The neural networks are run in Google's Tensorflow framework.
